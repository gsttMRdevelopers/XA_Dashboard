Please ensure you have downloaded Github desktop on your computer (this is not a neccessity but it means that updates are automatically changed on your computer). This script can either be run locally or in a venv.  For either method, navigate to the folder on your computer where you want to save the code.  Once you have done this, open a terminal in that location and run the following command:

```python
git clone https://github.com/oscarlally/XA_Dashboard
```

If you want to do this via a virtual environment (RECOMMENDED), navigate to the project directory and run the below commands.  

Navigate to the tailwind-dashboard-template-main directory, and run

```python
npm install
```

Then run,

```python
npm run dev
```

And then open the port that your terminal is running the application from, usually:

```python
http://localhost:5173/
```
